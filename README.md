**TimeGPT** is a pretrained transformer-based foundation model designed for general time series forecasting, capable of zero-shot or fine-tuned prediction across multiple horizons.

**Comparison of Forecasting Results Using TimeGPT with Different Features**

- We compare forecasting performance with and without cloud features for solar irradiance.
- Metric scores for each feature are available in the `Score_Result` folder.
- Comparisons are conducted between cloud-feature and no-cloud-feature settings.
- The project is currently in progress; however, metric scores for all features are complete.
