# Result_TimeGPT
# TimeGPT is a pretrained transformer-based foundation model designed for general time series forecasting, capable of zero-shot or fine-tuned prediction across multiple horizons.
#Compare the result of Forecasting by TimeGPT with different Feature
## We compare the result with cloud feature and without cloud feature for solar irradiance.
## You can come to check the Matric score in folder Score_Result for each feature.
## You can compare the Matric for cloud feature and without cloud feature.
## The project is in progress, but metric scores for all features are complete.
